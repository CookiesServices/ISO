15 🌟 Stars = Add anti debug to lower detection <br>

A botnet is a group of Internet-connected devices such as laptops, computors and servers, each of which runs one or more bots. Botnets can be used to steal data, send spam, and allow the attacker to access the device and its connection. The owner can control the botnet using command and control software over a very clean and modern GUI.

Eachd command has been created in mind to stop all crashes and unexpected fails meaning u never have to worry about loosing your connection. Open ports will be needed to be able to connect to the target machines. There are also many of ways to infect a device such a remote infection or the victim running a malious malawre application.
